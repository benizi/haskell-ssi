# haskell-ssi

Server Side Includes (SSI) processor written in Haskell

# Background

My website has accumulated cruft over the years.  In the beginning, one of the
technologies I used, since Apache Httpd was everywhere, was SSI.

The most recent incarnation of my site is now served by Caddy, so I needed a
way to parse the few old `.shtml` files I still cared about.

# Features

Features that are planned or implemented.

- [x] Terrible code organization (initial version in single file).
- [ ] Better-organized code (names, splits).
- [ ] FastCGI env setup (currently just a cli script w/ config via env vars).
- [ ] Rename executable from `ssi` to `haskell-ssi`. (maybe worksforme)

# SSI Directives

I only really care about "old style" SSI, and even then, only really about the
few directives I used back in ~2005.

- [x] `<!--#if expr="..."--><!--#else--><!--#endif-->`
- [x] `<!--#config timefmt="..."-->`
- [ ] `<!--#echo var="..."-->` where var is ...
  - [x] `DATE_LOCAL`
  - [x] `DATE_GMT`
  - [ ] `LAST_MODIFIED`
  - [ ] `DOCUMENT_URI` (might just copy from `$REQUEST_URI`) (maybe wontfix)
  - [ ] `DOCUMENT_NAME` (maybe wontfix)
  - [ ] `QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED` (maybe wontfix)
  - [x] Any other environment variable
- [x] `<!--#set var="..." value="..."-->`
- [x] `<!--#include file="..."-->`
- [ ] `<!--#include virtual="..." -->`
